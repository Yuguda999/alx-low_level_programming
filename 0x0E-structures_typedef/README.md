## Introduction

This repository contains C programming structures and typedef examples and solutions to various questions related to C programming concepts. Each code example is well-documented and follows coding style guidelines.

## Code Examples

### Struct Definition

In the `dog.h` file, you'll find the definition of the `struct dog` and the `dog_t` type alias.

### Initializing a Struct

The `init_dog` function in `dog.c` initializes a `struct dog` with provided values for name, age, and owner.

### Creating a Dog Structure

The `new_dog` function in `dog.c` creates a new `struct dog` and stores copies of the name and owner strings.

### Freeing Memory for Dogs

The `free_dog` function in `dog.c` frees memory allocated for a `struct dog`, including its name and owner.

## Usage

You can use these C code examples as a reference for common programming tasks or as a starting point for your own C projects.
