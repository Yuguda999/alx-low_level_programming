    int absNum = ABS(num);
    
    printf("Absolute value of %d is %d\n", num, absNum);
    
    return 0;
}Sum MacroThe SUM(x, y) macro computes the sum of two numbers x and y. It simply adds the two numbers together.To use the SUM(x, y) macro in your code:#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 7;
    int result = SUM(num1, num2);
    
    printf("Sum of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, result);
    
    return 0;
}PI MacroThe constants.h header file defines the PI macro as an abbreviation for the value 3.14159265359.Header File with Macro DefinitionsThe myheader.h header file defines the SIZE macro as an abbreviation for the token 1024.Other MacrosThe repository also includes other macros for handling buffer sizes, table sizes, and more.
